# 📧 AI Email Labeling Automation with n8n

This workflow automates the process of organizing your Gmail inbox by intelligently labeling incoming emails using AI.

## 🚀 How it works
* **Trigger**: Checks for new emails daily.
* **AI Logic**: Uses GPT-4 (or Gemini) to analyze email content based on predefined labels: **Lead**, **Pub**, and **Famille**.
* **Action**: Automatically applies the corresponding label directly in Gmail.

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Import `workflow.json` into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail OAuth2 credentials.
3. Add your OpenAI or Gemini API Key.
